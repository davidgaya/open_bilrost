### GET | Retrieve Workspace Status

**/assetmanager/workspaces/{workspace_guid||workspace_name}/status**

A Workspace has an integrity status (related to the integrity of Assets/Resources) and a synchrony status (when compared to the DLC it was cloned from). The result of this request is an object that includes the workspace information, as well as the Workspace's integrity and synchrony statuses.

Synchrony Tokens:

- **UP_TO_DATE**: The Workspace contains exactly the same Assets/Resources as the DLC.
- **OUT_OF_DATE**: There is a newer version of the Workspace on the DLC, compared to the Workspace.
- **MODIFIED**: The Workspace has been modified (Assets and/or Resources have been changed). Changes need to be committed.
- **CONFLICTED**: There have been both local and remote changes since the last time the workspace was synchronized.

Integrity tokens:

- **VALID**: Internal validation passed.
- **PENDING**: This validation is pending.
- **MISSING**: This validation has not been ran yet.
- **INVALID**: This validation has failed.

The response of a Workspace status request looks like this:

```javascript
{ 
    workspace_name: "workspace_name", 
    workspace_guid: "workspace_guid", 
    url: "vcs_url", 
    sync_status: "*synchrony_token*", 
    integrity_status: "*integrity_token*"
    refs: [
        {
            ref: '/assets/test',
            sync_status: 'MODIFIED',
            integrity_status: 'VALID',
        },
        {
            ref: '/resources/test',
            sync_status: 'OUT_OF_DATE',
            integrity_status: 'VALID',
        },
    ],
}
```

## GET | Retrieve Asset/Resource Status

**/assetmanager/workspaces/{workspace_guid||workspace_name}/status{asset_ref||resource_ref}**

Each Asset/Resource in a Workspace has a synchrony status. Here are the current status tokens for Assets and Resources (these status tokens were inspired by the 'git status' documentation).

Synchrony tokens:

- **UP_TO_DATE**: The local Asset/Resource is exactly the same as the one on the DLC. *This status is only shown if a specific Asset/Resource is requested upon, not when a root or folder level request is made.* 
- **OUT_OF_DATE**: There is a newer version of the Asset/Resource remotely, compared to the one the user last updated.
- **MODIFIED**: The local Asset/Resource has been changed.
- **DELETED**: The Asset/Resource has been deleted.
- **RENAMED**: The Asset/Resource has changed names or moved.
- **EXTERNAL**: The Asset/Resource is versioned on an external repository.
- **NEW**: The Asset/Resource has been created.
- **CONFLICTED**: There is a conflict between the local changed and remote updated versions of the Asset/Resource.

Integrity tokens:

- **VALID**: Internal validation passed.
- **PENDING**: This validation is pending.
- **MISSING**: This validation has not been ran yet.
- **INVALID**: This validation has failed.

A revision object typically looks like this:

``
